# Why should you take that job that you don't like?

<!-- Intro -->

Back in 2018, I received a job offer I didn't want to accept. It was my only
offer after sending more than 50 resumes, which led to just a little more than
10 interviews.

After thinking a lot about it, I decided to accept the offer and now I ask
myself this question: Why should you take that job that you don't like?

Here are my seven answers:

<!-- Team -->

## 1. Cause you'll learn that we win together and we lose together too

You will learn how to be part of a team and how to appreciate its diversity.

You will start noticing the differences among team members, and you will accept
those. You'll find out that such differences make the team stronger. That it
does not matter how out of place you might feel, you too are an essential part
of that team.

They don't need to be your dearest friends, but you'll learn the importance of
moving ahead together towards a common goal. Because we lose together and we win
together too.

<!-- Leadership -->

## 2. Cause you'll discover that a true leader is more than only a title

You will learn that the personality and style of a leader cascades down through
their people.

Just the way that a leader who lacks a clear vision will confuse their team,
filling them with frustration and anxiety, so will a visionary leader inspire
their people. One who listens and communicates. One who has a strong idea of
where they're heading.

You will taste the meaning of leadership by yourself, finding out that a true
leader is more than only a title. It's a way of being.

<!-- Patience and communication -->

## 3. Cause you'll learn the art of communication

You will understand that we all come from different places and therefore see
things from different places too. Then you will become a better listener and a
more empathetic person, and at the same time you'll become better at speaking on
each other's terms.

You'll learn to pick your battles. To let go of your own ideas in favor of other
people's ideas, because often times that's the best thing to do.

You will also realize that it is inevitable to be misunderstood, and so the art
of communication is all about accepting that the other person is always right.

It is our duty then to become artists. The artists of communication.

<!-- Women -->

## Because you will discover that more women are needed in the workplace.

You'll begin to recognize them for their value in the work environment and
everywhere else, and you'll form a more realistic and everywhere, and you will
form a more realistic image of them. An image far removed from the stereotypes
the stereotypes many of us have about their roles.

You will find fantastic leaders, with and without the title. Women with
initiative and vision. Capable of organizing entire teams and solving difficult
problems.

You'll also find women who take care of others, who are assertive without being
arbitrary. Often nicer and more empathetic than many of the guys I've come
across. I've come across.

You'll learn that this is why we need more women in the workplace. Then maybe
we'll we'll learn something from them.

<!-- Give, don't ask -->

## Because you'll learn that success isn't earned. You earn it.

You're going to learn that people don't look at your past. They don't care about
your accomplishments your success stories, let alone how many great people
you've met in your life. you've met in your life. The rest of us can only see
what you do now. Your actions and words today are what define you tomorrow.

You will discover that being good at being a student is not the same as being
good at your career. career. No matter how many gold medals and diplomas you
have earned, it is not enough to ask. enough to ask. You have to give first.

<!-- Friends -->

## Because you will meet many new people. People who will become lifelong friends.

You will make friends. Lots of them. Passing friends, hallway friends and
friends for life. friends.

If you are lucky, you will travel. You will travel to unknown and distant
places, and you will have and you will live unforgettable experiences with
extraordinary people.

After all, you never know when one of them will help you move to a new house or
go on a or will go on a European tour with you. One day, you might even find
love. you might even find love. Translated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free

## 7. Because it can result in much more than you expect.

3 years ago I wanted to say no to my only job offer after months of job hunting.
looking for a job. The offer from
[Continental](https://www.continental-jobs.com/) was certainly attractive. I
would be moving to a new city, with very good pay and benefits, and in a very
seductive benefits, and in a very seductive _research and development_ position.

However, by the time I received the news, I was already in the middle of other
interviews. These were very interesting to me at the time, so I was afraid of
rushing into a I was afraid to rush into giving a yes. I was afraid to stand
there, all the time, wishing I was somewhere else. wishing I was somewhere else.

And I'm not going to lie to you, because in fact I was. After I accepted, I kept
wishing to be somewhere else for quite a while. It is to this day that I look
back at the time I spent there and I can say that I did not I can say that I
don't regret my decision.

The road was full of people who became very important to me, and of experiences
and opportunities that transformed me. experiences and opportunities that
transformed me in countless dimensions.

This text is thus a brief collection of my learnings along that road and, with
that path and, with ~~lucky~~ effort, the beginning of something more (ðŸ˜‰).

Now there is only one thing left for me to say: **Thank you, Conti**.

This text is then a brief discussion of my learnings in that journey and,
hopefully, the beginning of something more. ;)
