# Why should you take that job that you don't like?

<!-- Intro -->

Back in 2018, I received a job offer that I didn't want to accept. It was the
only offer after sending more than 50 resumes and just a little more than 10
interviews.

After thinking a lot about it, I decided to accept the offer, and now I ask
myself this question: Why should you take that job that you don't like?

Here are my seven answers:

<!-- Team -->

## 1. Cause you'll learn that we win together and we lose together too

You will learn how to be part of a team and how to appreciate its diversity.

You will start noticing the differences among team members, and you will accept
them. You'll find out that such differences make the team stronger. That it does
not matter how out of place you might feel, you too are an essential part of
that team.

They don't need to be your dearest friends, but you'll learn the importance of
moving ahead together towards a common goal. Because we lose together and we win
together too.

<!-- Leadership -->

## 2. Cause you'll discover that a true leader is more than only a title

You will learn that the personality and style of a leader cascades down through
their people.

Just the way that a leader who lacks a clear vision will confuse their team,
filling them with frustration and anxiety, so will a visionary leader inspire
their people. One who listens and communicates. One who has a strong idea of
where they're heading.

You will taste the meaning of leadership by yourself, finding out that a true
leader is more than only a title. It's a way of being.

<!-- Patience and communication -->

## 3. Cause you'll learn the art of communication

You will understand that we all come from different places and therefore see
things from different places too. Then you will become a better listener and a
more empathetic person and, at the same time, you'll become better at speaking
on each other's terms.

You'll learn to pick your battles. To let go of your ideas in favor of other
people's ideas, because oftentimes that's the best thing to do.

You will also realize that it is inevitable to be misunderstood, and so the art
of communication is all about accepting that the other person is always right.

It is our duty then to become artists. The artists of communication.

<!-- Women -->

## 4. Cause you will discover why we need more women in the workplace

You will begin to value women for what they bring to the workplace --- and
everywhere. You will form a new image of them for yourself. One that is more
realistic, far from the stereotypes that many of us have about their roles.

You will get to know amazing female leaders, with and without the title.
Proactive women with a clear vision. Women who are determined but not arbitrary.
Capable of coordinating teams and solving tough problems.

And yes, you will also find women who take care of others. Often warmer and more
empathetic than many of the guys I've met.

You will realize this is why we need more women in the workplace. Maybe then
could we all learn from their behaviors.

<!-- Give, don't ask -->

## 5. Cause you will learn that you don't deserve success. You earn it

You are going to find out that people won't care about your past achievements.
Neither will they care about your old success stories. Much less how many
super-awesome folks you've met before.

The rest of us can only see what you're doing now. Your actions and your words
today define you for tomorrow.

You will also find out that being a good student will not instantaneously make
you good at your career. It does not matter how many gold medals are hanging on
your neck, it ain't ever gonna be enough to just stand there asking.

You must give first. Don't ask.

<!-- Friends -->

## 6. Cause you're gonna meet a bunch of new people, people who will become your new close friends

You will make new friends. Lots of them. Passing-by friends, coffee & taco
friends, and friends for life.

If you are lucky enough, you will travel. To unknown and distant places, and you
will live unforgettable experiences along with extraordinary people.

After all, you could never know which of them is going to help you move to a new
house or join you on a backpacking adventure. Someday maybe, you could even find
love all the better.

<!-- Punchline -->

## 7. Cause it may turn out to be much more than you are expecting

Three years ago, I wanted to say no to the only job offer I had received after
months of searching. Sure, the offer from
[Continental](https://www.continental-jobs.com/) was indeed attractive. I would
be moving to a new city to work in a very seductive R&D position, with great pay
and benefits.

However, by the time I received the news of the offer, I was already going
through a couple more hiring processes. These were very interesting to me at the
time and so I was afraid of rushing into a _Yes_. I was afraid of coming into
the office every day, wishing all the time that I were somewhere else.

And I won't lie to you, because it was in fact like that. For a while. It is
only to this day that I can look back at the time spent there and say I don't
regret my decision.

The road was full of people who became very important to me. It was also full of
opportunities that transformed who I am in countless dimensions.

This text is thus a brief collection of my learnings along that road and, with
some ~~luck~~ effort, the beginning of something more ðŸ˜‰.

Now there is only one thing left for me to say: **Thank you, Conti.**
