Machine Learning Engineer
OpenAI
SAN FRANCISCO

The Machine Learning Engineer role is responsible for building AI systems that can perform previously impossible tasks or achieve unprecedented levels of performance. This requires good engineering (for example: designing, implementing, and improving a massive-scale distributed machine learning system), writing bug-free machine learning code (surprisingly difficult!), and building the science behind the algorithms employed. In all the projects this role pursues, the ultimate goal is to push the field forward.

The most outstanding deep learning results are increasingly attained at massive scale, and these results require engineers who are comfortable working in a large distributed systems. We expect engineering to play a key role in most major advances in AI of the future.

You should apply if you are a software engineer who is fairly comfortable with linear algebra, basic statistics, and the basics of stochastic gradient descent. Experience in machine learning is a bonus. You are not expected to have mastery of deep learning — the problems we pursue are always at the edge of the state of the art, which means that nobody's an expert.

AI is the new electricity. There are millions of opportunities to transform industries with artificial intelligence, but today’s AI job market is broad and undefined. It isn’t always clear to AI engineers - novices and experts alike - how to determine which opportunities best match their career interests and skill sets.

We’re looking for entry-level and experienced AI engineers of all levels who are seeking new technical roles. We’d like to learn what you’re looking for in your next opportunity, and match you with potential roles available in our community. These are applied engineering roles spanning industries including education, manufacturing, health-care, autonomous driving, energy and transportation, robotics, media and entertainment, and more.

Who should apply

If you’re an engineer familiar with machine learning techniques, we’d like to hear from you. That means you’re probably familiar with most of the following:

Deep learning. You should be able to understand and apply major deep learning methods, including neural network training, regularization, optimization methods (gradient descent, Adam), and be familiar with major neural network architecture types such as Convolutional Networks, RNN/LSTM. Completion of the deeplearning.ai specialization is sufficient to meet this criteria.

Machine learning. You should be able to understand and apply major machine learning methods, such as logistic regression, SVM, Decision Trees, Principal Component Analysis and K-means. Completion of Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning course on Coursera is sufficient to meet this criteria.

Implementation. You should have prior experience taking a dataset, cleaning it if necessary, and applying a learning algorithm to it to get a result. You should be able to implement a learning algorithm “from scratch” using a framework such as Tensorflow, Pytorch, Caffe, etc.

General coding. You should be able to code non-trivial functions in object oriented programming, such as popular sorting or search algorithms. You should know how to use your terminal, and work with version control systems (Git). Software engineering experience such as working with relational databases, APIs, and building the back-end of web or mobile applications is helpful but is not required.

Mathematics (including probabilities and statistics.) You should be able to use mathematical notations and linear algebra (matrix/vector operations, dot products, etc.), and understand basic probability theory (distributions, independence, density functions, etc.) as well as statistics (mean, variance, median, quantiles, co-variance, etc.)
